    as you already know, im not a person that write long letters (coz i cant write long letters)
    but since itâ€™s your birthday, I wanted to write you a letter because you deserve the most extraordinary things in life. 
    meeting u as a friend, probably is the best thing that i could ask. because you've been really special to me.  
    you are a kind and caring person.
    we've made so many memories together and i hope we get to make more.
    once again, happy birthday.
