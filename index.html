    as you already know, im not a person who writes long letters (coz i cant write long letters LOL)
    but since itâ€™s your birthday, I wanted to write you a letter because you deserve it. (yup) 
    meeting u as a friend, probably is the best thing that i could ask for. because you've been really different to me. (in general means special lol) 
    actually knowing u as a friend is rlly unexpected (coz of our age gap lol) but still, we became friends in the end (LMAO) 
    we've made so many memories together and i hope we get to make more.
    once again, happy birthday.
