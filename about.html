      time passes so fast that this is the 7th year of us knowing each other (why does it sound like we r alr old). 
      ithink the first time we actually started talking was u sending me a text on whatsapp saying u r going on holiday somewhere ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ (i forgot to whr alr lol) and we got closer during std 6. 
      being deskmates with u made my life merrier (?) coz we fought alot then LMAO.
      we have created so many funny memories together and i hope to create more with you (lol).
      once again, happy birthday !!!!!!
